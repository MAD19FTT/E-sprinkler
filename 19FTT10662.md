# Part 1 - setting up a vps

## 1.Generate Key
Generate key using code `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519  -C "19FTT1066@student.pb.edu.bn"` on any available terminal and name it as sop_as2. Then By using the code `cat sop_as1.pub` to view the long code of public key and then copy paste the key to the vps droplet

## 2.create water droplet on a vps
open vps platform website like digital ocean and then create a water droplet on it by filling in the detail like images, region, package plan and others
```
Details used in the creation:
* images - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Region - Singapore
* Linode plan - $10
* label - sop-as2
* Root password - Jiygej8VFmhBqw#

The ip address of the vps is `172.104.40.197`
The vps platform used is linode
```
## 3.Connecting and configure VPS
- enter the code ` ssh root@172.104.40.197` to connect to the VPS
- enter code `adduser ftt1066` to add user ftt1066 to the VPS
- enter code `usermod -aG sudo ftt1066` to grant user administrative privilegede
- activate firewall by activating the ufw by using `sudo ufw enable` then allow the necessary port in the ufw by using `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH`, `sudo ufw allow 80` and `sudo ufw allow 443`
- `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` to open the ssh configuration then change the PasswordAuthentication to no
- create shortcut by change directory to .ssh folder with `cd .ssh` first, then enter code `atom config` to open a config file through a text editor software and finally enter the following detail
```
Host as1
HostName 172.104.54.132
User ftt1066
PreferredAuthentications publickey,password
IdentitiesOnly yes
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sop_as1

Host as2
HostName 172.104.40.197
User ftt1066
PreferredAuthentications publickey,password
IdentitiesOnly yes
```
## 4.Set time zone
By entering the command `sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Brunei` the time zone is changed to brunei time, user can check it by entering `timedatectl`

## 5.Changing hostname on vps
First, edit the cloud config script with the command `sudo nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` and change the preserve hostname to `true`.

Thirdly, enter the command `sudo nano /etc/hosts` to open the file and add the hostname in the second line like below
```
127.0.0.1 localhost

127.0.1.1 sop-as2

```
Lastly, restart the vps by keying in `sudo reboot` and log in to the vps again to verify if the ssh login terminal has changed to ftt1066@sop-as2

## 6.Disable root login
`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` to open the ssh configuration then change the PermitRootLogin to no, this allow only non root user to login

# Part 2 - Assign a domain to vps

To get a free domain, user will need to have a github student package to aquire free domain for a year. After acquiring the domain name, user will need to connect it to the vps via A record. In this case the domain name is esprinkler and dns provider is tech.com, by opening a domain dashboard in tech.com, user can create an A record by clicking on the manage dns at the very bottom of the page. Fill in the A record with the information below
